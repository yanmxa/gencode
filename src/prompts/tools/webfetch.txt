Fetches content from a URL and processes it.

Takes a URL and a prompt as input:
1. Fetches the URL content
2. Converts HTML to markdown
3. Processes the content with the prompt using a fast model
4. Returns the model's response about the content

Usage:
- The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
- HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
- The prompt should describe what information you want to extract

<example>
Fetching documentation:
url: "https://docs.example.com/api"
prompt: "Extract the authentication methods and their parameters"
</example>

<example>
Reading a GitHub README:
url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
prompt: "Summarize the project's main features and installation steps"
</example>

Behavior notes:
- Results may be summarized if content is very large
- Includes a 15-minute cache for faster repeated access
- When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool will inform you and provide the redirect URL - make a new WebFetch request with that URL

Best Practices:
- Be specific in your prompt about what information you need
- Use for documentation, tutorials, and reference material
- Combine with WebSearch to find relevant URLs first
