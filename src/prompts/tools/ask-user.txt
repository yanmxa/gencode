Use this tool when you need to ask the user questions during execution.

CRITICAL: You MUST use this tool for ANY question with 2+ choices. NEVER present options as plain text, numbered lists, or bullet points.

WRONG (never do this):
- "Which do you prefer? 1. Option A 2. Option B"
- "What type? - Web - CLI - API"
- Writing any numbered or bulleted choices in your response

CORRECT: Call this tool with structured questions and options.

This allows you to:
1. Gather user preferences or requirements
2. Clarify ambiguous instructions
3. Get decisions on implementation choices as you work
4. Offer choices to the user about what direction to take

## When to Use This Tool

Use when you encounter:
- Ambiguous requirements that could be interpreted multiple ways
- Technology choices where user preference matters (database, framework, etc.)
- Implementation approaches with different trade-offs
- Features or options that should be user-selected

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Don't use for:
- Asking "Is my plan ready?" or "Should I proceed?" - just proceed or use planning tools
- Simple yes/no confirmations - just make a reasonable choice
- Questions you can answer by reading the codebase
- Trivial implementation details

## Usage Guidelines

- Keep headers short (max 12 chars): "Database", "Auth", "Features"
- Provide 2-4 options per question
- Put recommended option FIRST and add "(Recommended)" to its label
- Use multiSelect: true for non-mutually-exclusive options
- "Other" option is automatically added - don't include it manually
- Keep option labels concise (1-5 words)
- Descriptions should explain trade-offs or implications

      { "label": "SQLite", "description": "Lightweight embedded DB" }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

### Multi-Select - Feature Selection
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Which features should we enable?",
    "header": "Features",

      ],
      "multiSelect": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Constraints

- Maximum 4 questions per call
