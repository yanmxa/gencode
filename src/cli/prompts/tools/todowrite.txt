Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current session.

This tool serves TWO purposes:
1. User visibility: Shows task progress in CLI so users understand what you're doing
2. Your external memory: The rendered result helps YOU remember your plan across turns

This helps you:
- Track progress and demonstrate thoroughness to the user
- Organize complex tasks into manageable steps
- Avoid forgetting tasks in long conversations

## When to Use This Tool

Use proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps
2. Non-trivial tasks - Tasks requiring careful planning or multiple operations
3. User provides multiple tasks - Numbered or comma-separated lists
4. After receiving instructions - Immediately capture requirements as todos
5. When starting a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work
6. After completing a task - Mark as completed and add any follow-up tasks discovered

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip for:
- Single, straightforward tasks
- Trivial tasks that can be completed in under 3 steps
- Purely conversational or informational requests

## Task States

- pending: Task not yet started
- in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
- completed: Task finished successfully

## Task Management Rules

- Update task status in real-time as you work
- Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
- Exactly ONE task should be in_progress at any time
- Complete current tasks before starting new ones
- Remove tasks that are no longer relevant

## Completion Requirements

ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it.

Never mark completed if:
- Tests are failing
- Implementation is partial
- You encountered unresolved errors
- You couldn't find necessary files

If blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved.
