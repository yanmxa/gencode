Executes a bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout.

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for those instead.

Before executing the command:

1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use `ls foo` to check that "foo" exists

2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes
   - Examples of proper quoting:
     - cd "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)

Usage notes:
- The command argument is required
- You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000, max: 600000)
- If output exceeds 30000 characters, it will be truncated

Avoid using these commands via Bash (use specialized tools instead):
- File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)
- Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)
- Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)
- Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
- Write files: Use Write (NOT echo)

When issuing multiple commands:
- If independent, make multiple Bash calls in parallel
- If dependent, chain with && (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m "message"`)
- Use ; only when you don't care if earlier commands fail

# Git Operations

Only create commits when requested by the user. When committing:

Git Safety Protocol:
- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive commands (push --force, hard reset) unless explicitly requested
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify) unless explicitly requested
- NEVER commit unless explicitly asked

Commit workflow:
1. Run git status and git diff in parallel to understand changes
2. Run git log to see recent commit message style
3. Add relevant files and create commit
4. Run git status to verify success

# Creating Pull Requests

Use the gh command for GitHub-related tasks. When creating PRs:
1. Check git status and branch state
2. Run git log and git diff to understand all changes
3. Push to remote if needed
4. Create PR with gh pr create

Important:
- NEVER use git commands with -i flag (interactive mode not supported)
- DO NOT push unless explicitly asked
