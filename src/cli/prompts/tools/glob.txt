Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size.

Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts".

Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time.

Usage:
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- Supports standard glob syntax:
  - * matches any characters except /
  - ** matches any characters including /
  - ? matches a single character
  - [abc] matches any of a, b, or c
  - {a,b} matches either a or b

<example>
Find all TypeScript files:
pattern: "**/*.ts"
</example>

<example>
Find test files:
pattern: "**/*.test.{ts,js}"
</example>

<example>
Find files in a specific directory:
pattern: "src/components/**/*.tsx"
</example>

Best Practices:
- Use specific patterns to narrow results
- Combine with Read to examine matching files
- Call multiple globs in parallel if searching for different patterns
- Use Grep instead if you need to search file contents
