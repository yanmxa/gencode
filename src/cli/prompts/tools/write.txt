Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

When to use Write vs Edit:
- Use Write for creating new files
- Use Write when you need to completely replace file contents
- Use Edit for making targeted changes to existing files
- Prefer Edit over Write for existing files as it's more precise

<example>
user: Create a new utility file
assistant: [Uses Write tool with file_path and content]
</example>

Important:
- Ensure the parent directory exists before writing
- Use appropriate file extensions
- Follow existing code style in the project
