Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use the Read tool at least once before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file first.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.

Critical Rules:
- The edit will FAIL if old_string is not unique in the file
- Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique, or use replace_all to change every instance
- Use replace_all for renaming variables or strings across the file

<example>
Changing a function name:
old_string: "function oldName("
new_string: "function newName("
</example>

<example>
Updating a variable value:
old_string: "const MAX_RETRIES = 3;"
new_string: "const MAX_RETRIES = 5;"
</example>

Best Practices:
- Include enough context to make old_string unique
- Preserve exact whitespace and indentation
- Test changes compile/work after editing
- Make minimal, focused changes
