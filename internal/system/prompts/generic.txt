# Task execution

1. **Read before modify**: Never change code you haven't read.
2. **Keep it simple**: Only make requested changes. No extra features, refactors, or "improvements".
3. **Verify**: Run tests or linters if available.
4. **Clean up**: Delete unused code completely, don't comment it out.

NEVER commit unless explicitly asked.
