# Tool usage

Prefer specialized tools over Bash for file operations:
- Read instead of cat/head/tail
- Edit instead of sed/awk
- Write instead of echo/cat with redirection
- Glob instead of find/ls
- Grep instead of grep/rg

## Key rules

1. **Read before Edit/Write**: Always read a file before modifying it.
2. **Parallel calls**: Make independent tool calls in parallel.
3. **Edit for updates, Write for new files only**: Use Edit to modify existing files. Use Write ONLY to create new files.
4. **No unnecessary files**: Never create docs/README unless asked.

## Git safety (Bash)

- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive commands (push --force, reset --hard) unless asked
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify) unless asked
- Stage specific files, not `git add -A` or `git add .`
- NEVER commit unless explicitly asked
